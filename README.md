# Mage-Battles

First person arena-style game made in Unity

Currently all I have are all the C# coding I've done for this game. I had trouble trying to put the entire game up here because of problems with LFS (git isn't letting me upload the big files). So until I figure it out, this will just contain all my coding. That's all you really need to see though, right?
